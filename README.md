This is a fork of very good vim plugin manager **vim-plug**, where I will implement additional functionality for mine own taste.

## New functions
* `PlugHelp` - opens readme(*.md, *.rst and all other) file for the plugin. This command is particularly useful for small plugins, like color schemes or syntax enhancers, which do not have help docs. Very useful while managing plugins collection.
